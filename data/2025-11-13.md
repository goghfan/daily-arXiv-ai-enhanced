Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统性的评估方法来分析和量化基于修复的说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄露问题，通过三种互补的测试设置和衍生指标来建立更可靠的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在修改嘴唇运动时可能引入嘴唇泄露问题，即生成的嘴唇受到参考图像的影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，这种泄露难以通过标准指标和常规测试检测。

Method: 提出包含三个互补测试设置的系统评估框架：静音输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对、匹配的音频-视频合成，并引入嘴唇同步差异和基于静音音频的嘴唇同步分数等衍生指标。

Result: 该方法能够有效分析和量化嘴唇泄露问题，并研究了不同身份参考选择对泄露的影响，为参考设计提供见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法是模型无关的，为未来说话人脸生成研究建立了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个多无人机监控数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决动态相机位置和复杂遮挡下的行人跟踪问题，在复杂环境中保持约90%的检测和跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动态相机位置和复杂遮挡，需要开发能够应对这些挑战的多视角检测和跟踪系统。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个位置连续变化的无人机同步视频）和深度学习框架，包括实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、鸟瞰图中的多视角特征融合。

Result: 在复杂环境中保持约90%的检测跟踪精度，成功跟踪约80%的轨迹，迁移学习和相机丢失实验显示良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视角监控系统提供了重要基准，展示了在复杂环境中的鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，使用统一内存库而非任务特定的子内存库，通过最近邻匹配机制实现最先进的检测精度，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别子内存库的问题，这限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出一个所有任务共享统一内存库的CAD框架，在训练期间通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，在推理阶段通过最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%的异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测精度的同时提高了持续异常检测的灵活性和可扩展性，并在实际场景中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

### [5] [Predict and Resist: Long-Term Accident Anticipation under Sensor Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08640)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的actor-critic模型，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，解决传感器噪声和及时可靠预测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事故预测对于主动安全的自动驾驶至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：传感器输入噪声或退化，以及需要平衡早期预警与误报抑制的及时可靠预测。

Method: 集成扩散去噪模块和时间感知actor-critic模型。扩散模块通过迭代细化重建噪声鲁棒的图像和物体特征，actor-critic架构利用长期时间推理和时间加权奖励来确定最佳预警时机。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（DAD、CCD、A3D）上展示了最先进的准确性和显著的平均事故时间增益，在高斯和脉冲噪声下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定且与人类对齐的预测，突显其在现实世界安全关键部署中的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [6] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名化适配器模块从视频特征中移除私人信息，同时保持任务效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私保护方法主要关注输入像素级的匿名化，需要重新训练整个视频模型，导致任务特定的匿名化，不适合现代视频基础模型。视频特征共享会无意中泄露敏感个人信息。

Method: 引入轻量级匿名化适配器模块(AAM)，采用三种新设计的训练目标：片段级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可在冻结的视频编码器上即插即用。

Result: 评估显示隐私泄露显著减少35%，同时在动作识别、时序动作检测和异常检测等下游任务中保持接近基线的效用性能，有效减轻性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效、可泛化的隐私保护解决方案，能够在保护隐私的同时保持任务性能，促进更公平的视频理解。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了自回归逐像素预测的缩放特性，发现最优缩放策略高度依赖具体任务，图像分类和生成的缩放需求存在显著差异，且计算资源是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性，为未来大规模视觉模型发展提供指导。

Method: 在32x32分辨率下训练一系列Transformer模型，使用IsoFlops配置文件，计算预算达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量。

Result: 发现图像分类和生成的最优缩放策略存在分歧，生成任务需要数据量增长比分类任务快3-5倍；随着分辨率增加，模型规模需比数据量增长更快；计算资源是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 基于计算资源每年增长4-5倍的预测，未来5年内有望实现逐像素图像建模的可行性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究使用扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth）生成平衡的训练数据，以解决图像分类系统中的群体偏见问题。通过聚类和分组训练DreamBooth模型，生成更准确的群体表示，在多个基准测试中优于原始Stable Diffusion，并与最先进的去偏技术相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统由于训练数据中群体分布不均而存在偏见，例如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据，但难以保持原始数据分布。本文旨在通过更精确的扩散模型微调技术来改善这一问题。

Method: 探索多种扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth），在每个群体内对图像进行聚类并为每个聚类训练一个DreamBooth模型，以防止单个模型被群体内变异淹没。使用这些模型生成群体平衡的预训练数据，然后在真实数据上进行微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，所研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，与最先进的去偏技术（如Group-DRO）结果相当，且在数据集偏见严重程度增加时表现更优。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能够有效生成更准确的群体平衡训练数据，缓解图像分类系统的偏见问题，特别是在严重偏见情况下表现突出，为数据去偏提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

### [9] [DT-NVS: Diffusion Transformers for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08823)
*Wonbong Jang,Jonathan Tremblay,Lourdes Agapito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DT-NVS是一个3D感知扩散模型，用于从单张图像生成真实世界日常场景的新视角视图，解决了现有方法局限于小相机移动或非自然物体中心场景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法主要关注真实场景中的小相机移动或仅考虑非自然的物体中心场景，限制了在真实世界设置中的潜在应用。本文旨在摆脱这些约束，处理真实世界、多类别、未对齐的日常场景视频。

Method: 提出DT-NVS，一个3D感知扩散模型，利用基于transformer的架构骨干。对transformer和自注意力架构做出重要贡献，将图像转换为3D表示，并采用新颖的相机条件策略在真实世界未对齐数据集上训练。引入新的训练范式，在条件图像和采样噪声输入之间交换参考帧的角色。

Conclusion: DT-NVS在真实世界日常场景的新视角合成方面表现出色，超越了现有方法，并能够生成多样化的结果。

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

*Jiaxun Guo,Manar Amayri,Nizar Bouguila,Xin Liu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的旋转不变性学习方法，通过引入阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因感受野受限而无法区分几何相似但空间不同结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变性方法使用手工制作的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然保证了旋转鲁棒性，但丢失了全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间不同的结构（如飞机左右机翼）。这种限制源于感受野受限导致的翼尖特征崩溃问题。

Method: 1) 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致的参考点（阴影），将局部RI描述符与全局姿态信息结合；2) 设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，将SiPF集成到特征聚合过程中；3) 基于Bingham分布的任务自适应阴影定位模块，动态学习最优全局旋转来构建一致的阴影。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有RI方法，特别是在需要任意旋转下细粒度空间分辨的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过结合局部旋转不变性和全局姿态感知，有效解决了现有RI方法的局限性，在保持旋转不变性的同时增强了模型对结构相似组件的区分能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤预后差，自动化、准确地识别其组织学亚区域有助于大规模形态学理解该疾病。

Method: 使用EfficientNet架构（B0-B4变体）的四步深度学习方法来分类6个组织病理学区域，在BraTS-Path数据集上进行5折交叉验证。

Result: EfficientNet-B1和B4在训练集上F1分数达0.98，但在验证集和测试集上分别降至0.546和0.517，显示模型泛化能力挑战。

Conclusion: 开发能够良好泛化到新数据的模型对临床应用至关重要，模型在训练集和测试集间的性能差异凸显了这一挑战。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications. The source code of the proposed approach can be found at the GitHub repository of Indiana University Division of Computational Pathology: https://github.com/IUCompPath/brats-path-2024-enet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了非对称跨模态知识蒸馏（ACKD）框架SemBridge，用于处理语义一致性较弱的多模态数据，通过学生友好匹配模块和语义感知知识对齐模块解决知识传输成本问题，在遥感场景分类任务中取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中配对模态数据有限，传统对称跨模态知识蒸馏（SCKD）应用受限，需要研究在弱语义一致性下的知识蒸馏方法。

Method: 提出SemBridge框架，包含学生友好匹配模块（利用自监督学习获取语义知识并动态选择相关教师样本）和语义感知知识对齐模块（采用拉格朗日优化寻找最优传输路径）。

Result: 在6种不同模型架构和多个数据集上，与7种现有方法相比取得了最先进性能。

Conclusion: ACKD框架能够有效处理弱语义一致性的跨模态知识蒸馏问题，SemBridge通过优化知识传输路径显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HitoMi-Cam是一种基于光谱反射特性的轻量级、形状无关的人员检测方法，在边缘设备上实现实时处理，在形状不可预测的场景（如灾难救援）中表现优于CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN目标检测的形状依赖性限制，特别是在训练数据中未包含的姿势下性能下降的问题，为形状不可预测的现实环境提供可行的检测方案。

Method: 基于服装光谱反射特性的形状无关人员检测方法，在无GPU的资源受限边缘设备上实现HitoMi-Cam系统。

Result: 处理速度达到23.2fps（253x190像素），在模拟搜救场景中平均精度达93.5%，优于对比CNN模型的最佳精度53.8%，且误报率极低。

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam不是CNN检测器的替代品，而是在特定条件下（如形状不可预测的灾难救援环境）的补充工具，光谱基人员检测在边缘设备实时运行中具有可行性。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

TL;DR: SPEED-Q是一个针对视觉语言模型(VLMs)的低比特权重量化框架，专门解决边缘设备部署中的两个关键问题：视觉和语言组件量化敏感性差异，以及低比特量化导致的训练不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署视觉语言模型需要低延迟和隐私保护，但由于资源限制，需要量化来提高内存效率和减少带宽需求。现有研究很少探索对1B到2B参数规模的VLMs进行激进量化。

Method: 提出了SPEED-Q框架，包含分阶段敏感性自适应机制来协调不同模态的性能，以及蒸馏增强量化策略来稳定训练过程并减少数据依赖。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SPEED-Q在2位设置下比现有量化方法准确率提高6倍，在2位和4位设置下均优于先前的设备端VLMs。

Conclusion: SPEED-Q是首个专门为小型十亿参数VLMs低比特量化设计的框架，能够实现准确、稳定且数据高效的复杂VLM量化。

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人机协同压缩方法主要基于人类视觉压缩流程，在整合机器视觉压缩时存在复杂度和比特率不足的问题。机器视觉仅关注图像/视频的核心区域，所需信息远少于人类视觉压缩信息。

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层蒸馏（HD）框架，将轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏从独立范式转变为协同组件，通过轨迹蒸馏建立结构"草图"，为后续基于分布的细化阶段提供近最优初始化，从而实现高保真单步扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的推理延迟是实时应用的关键障碍。现有的轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏方法存在根本性权衡：轨迹蒸馏保留全局结构但牺牲高频细节，分布蒸馏可实现更高保真度但常出现模式崩溃和不稳定训练。

Method: 提出分层蒸馏框架：1）利用轨迹蒸馏建立结构"草图"作为初始化；2）引入自适应加权判别器（AWD）进行基于分布的细化，通过动态分配token权重专注于局部缺陷；3）改进对抗训练过程。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，单步模型达到FID 2.26，媲美250步教师模型；在高分辨率文本到图像MJHQ基准测试中也取得良好结果，证明了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高保真单步扩散模型建立了一个稳健的新范式，通过协同利用轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏的优势，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的双向参考协调视频压缩方法BRHVC，通过双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合技术，优化了双向参考帧的利用，在HEVC数据集上超越了传统编码方法VTM-RA。


<details>

Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩相比P帧压缩研究不足，其分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层级，会造成两个参考帧的贡献不平衡。

Method: 提出了BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛（BMC）和双向上下文融合（BCF）。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更大尺度的准确运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，BRHVC在HEVC数据集上超越了之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至超过了传统编码方法VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考，为神经B帧视频压缩提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Motivation: 分形生成模型在生成高质量图像方面很高效，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性。需要一种方法来增强生成结果的多样性，同时保持高视觉质量。

Method: 1) 提出可学习的HD估计方法，直接从图像嵌入预测HD；2) 采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量调度策略来渐进优化超参数；3) 在推理阶段使用HD引导的拒绝采样来选择几何更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的广泛实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGM实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持了相当的图像质量。

Conclusion: 这是首个将HD引入FGM的工作，有效增强了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Conclusion: AuthSig框架成功解决了静态电子签名的安全认证问题，通过水印技术有效防止了签名的恶意复制和重用。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Conclusion: 所提出的模型能够有效处理噪声污染和强度不均匀的图像分割问题，在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

Conclusion: 负提示是推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni支持灵活的正负推理模式部署。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Motivation: 现有基于语言解码器的缓解方法通常独立调节视觉或文本注意力，忽视了它们作为两个关键因果因素的交互作用，无法有效解决大型视觉语言模型中的对象幻觉问题。

Method: 提出VTACR指标量化模态贡献不平衡；设计细粒度注意力干预机制，根据VTACR信号动态调整token和layer级别的注意力；采用双路径对比解码策略，一条路径强调视觉基础预测，另一条放大幻觉预测。

Result: 在POPE和CHAIR基准测试中，Owl实现了显著的幻觉减少，在保持视觉语言理解能力的同时，在忠实度方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Owl框架通过因果建模和注意力重加权有效缓解了对象幻觉问题，为视觉语言模型提供了更可靠的视觉基础预测能力。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Abstract: Existing unsupervised image alignment methods exhibit limited accuracy and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a dense cross-scale image alignment model. It takes into account the correlations between cross-scale features to decrease the alignment difficulty. Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型局限于特定领域且深度和可控性有限，难以泛化到多样化环境和交互形式。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构，结合基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态主干和视频扩散解码器，在大规模视频-动作对数据上训练，支持开放领域、动作条件模拟。

Result: 在动作条件世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN朝着通用世界模型迈进一步，能够为推理和行动提供未来世界状态的预测模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为方向正交对抗攻击（DOC）的新方法，通过引入正交梯度方向和动量更新来增强对抗攻击的多样性和覆盖范围，从而提高视觉-语言预训练模型在测试时防御中的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对抗攻击方法（如TTC）由于攻击和对抗攻击优化目标不同，仅基于对抗输入的梯度生成对抗攻击，导致搜索空间狭窄，攻击多样性不足，无法完全中和广泛的扰动。

Method: 提出DOC方法，通过正交梯度方向和动量更新来增强对抗攻击优化，扩大对抗攻击空间的探索，增加扰动多样性。同时引入基于平均余弦相似度的方向敏感度评分，提升样本区分度并自适应调节对抗攻击强度。

Conclusion: 增强对抗攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法通过正交梯度方向和动量更新有效实现了这一目标。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: 组合增量学习框架能够有效提升模型在持续学习新组合时的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了古日文草书识别领域在噪声处理方面的空白，为相关研究提供了新的基准和评估标准。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Motivation: AI生成视频技术快速发展，对内容安全和取证分析构成严重挑战。现有检测器主要依赖像素级视觉线索，对未见过的生成器泛化能力差。

Method: 提出DBINDS检测器，基于扩散模型反演分析潜在空间动态。发现真实视频和生成视频通过扩散反演恢复的初始噪声序列存在系统性差异，据此构建初始噪声差异序列(INDS)并提取多域多尺度特征。

Conclusion: DBINDS在有限数据设置下表现出良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为AI生成视频检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型越来越多地用于直接从图像生成皮肤病诊断叙述，但可靠的评估仍然是临床负责任部署的主要瓶颈。

Method: 构建DermBench基准（包含4000张真实皮肤病图像和专家认证的诊断叙述），并训练DermEval无参考多模态评估器，使用LLM评分器在临床维度上评估候选叙述。

Result: 在4500个病例的多样化数据集上，DermBench和DermEval与专家评分高度一致，平均偏差分别为0.251和0.117（满分5分）。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态LLM提供了可靠、可重复和可扩展的评估方法，能够测量诊断能力和可信度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常出现幻觉问题，特别是在对象存在性、属性和关系方面的错误，这降低了模型的可靠性。

Method: TACO将响应分解为原子查询，通过改写减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型精炼答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）上，使用两个MLLM（LLaVA-1.5-7B和CogVLM2）的实验表明，TACO始终优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少了系统性偏差，并改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的忠实度，证明了其在减轻幻觉方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽略了跨模态表示的潜力。本文探索利用CLIP的视觉-语言知识作为补充监督源。

Method: 提出简单有效的框架，将传统教师的logits和特征与CLIP的logits和特征融合，结合CLIP的多提示文本指导，捕捉数据集特定和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Result: 融合后的教师产生更自信可靠的预测，显著增加自信正确案例，减少自信错误案例。与CLIP融合还能优化整个logit分布，提高类间一致性和蒸馏质量。

Conclusion: RichKD方法在多个基准测试中持续优于现有基线，在分布偏移和输入损坏下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

*Jiangyong Yu,Changyong Shu,Sifan Zhou,Zichen Yu,Xing Hu,Yan Chen,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQ-PETR是一个针对PETR系列3D检测模型的全量化框架，通过量化友好位置嵌入、双查找表技术和量化后数值稳定化，在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降），同时减少75%延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR系列模型在3D检测基准上表现出色，但面临高计算成本和内存占用问题。现有量化方法直接应用于PETR会导致严重精度下降，主要由于多模态特征幅度差异和非线性算子量化效率低。

Method: 提出三个关键技术：1）量化友好LiDAR射线位置嵌入，用单点采样替代多点采样；2）双查找表算法，用两个级联线性LUT近似复杂非线性函数；3）量化后数值稳定化，在softmax数值稳定后执行量化。

Result: 在PETR系列模型上，FQ-PETR在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降），同时减少高达75%的延迟，显著优于现有PTQ和QAT基线方法。

Conclusion: FQ-PETR成功解决了PETR系列模型量化中的关键挑战，实现了高效压缩与精度保持的平衡，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Flora的零样本骨架动作识别方法，通过灵活的邻居感知语义调整和开放形式分布感知流分类器，解决了现有方法中脆弱的点对点对齐和刚性分类器的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本骨架动作识别中由于缺乏相应骨架先验而面临的挑战，特别是现有方法存在的两个基本问题：不完美语义导致的脆弱点对点对齐，以及静态决策边界和粗粒度锚点限制的刚性分类器。

Method: Flora方法包含两个核心组件：1）通过整合相邻类间上下文线索灵活调整文本语义，形成方向感知区域语义，结合跨模态几何一致性目标确保稳定鲁棒的点到区域对齐；2）使用无噪声流匹配弥合语义和骨架潜在嵌入之间的模态分布差距，同时通过无条件对比正则化增强判别性，实现具有细粒度决策边界的分布感知分类器。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，即使在仅使用10%可见数据训练的情况下也表现出特别令人印象深刻的性能。

Conclusion: Flora方法通过灵活的语义调整和分布感知分类器设计，有效解决了零样本骨架动作识别中的关键挑战，在多个数据集上取得了优越性能，特别是在数据稀缺情况下仍能保持良好表现。

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

TL;DR: OUGS是一个针对3D高斯泼溅的主动重建框架，通过物理参数推导不确定性并集成语义分割，实现更高效的对象中心重建。


<details>

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的支气管镜导航框架，通过2D-3D配准实现内窥镜视图与术前CT的实时对齐，并创建了首个公开的合成基准数据集用于标准化评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决支气管镜术中定位的挑战，包括呼吸运动、解剖变异和CT-身体差异导致的变形和错位问题，现有视觉方法难以跨域泛化。

Method: 使用微调的模态和域不变编码器直接计算真实内窥镜RGB帧与CT渲染深度图的相似度，通过可微分渲染模块迭代优化相机位姿，实现深度一致性配准。

Result: 仅在合成数据上训练，在基准测试中达到平均平移误差2.65毫米和旋转误差0.19弧度，在真实患者数据上表现出强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代视觉优化实现了鲁棒的域不变定位，新基准数据集为视觉支气管镜导航的标准化进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Motivation: 当前多目标跟踪方法主要针对日常场景或特定运动（如足球、篮球），而美式足球由于频繁遮挡和身体接触等挑战，缺乏标准化数据集，导致方法间难以公平比较。

Method: 构建首个美式足球运动员专用检测与跟踪数据集，对多种检测和跟踪方法进行比较评估，包括微调检测模型和集成重识别模型到跟踪系统中。

Result: 在拥挤场景下实现了准确的检测与跟踪，微调检测模型相比预训练模型性能提升，集成微调检测器和重识别模型后跟踪精度显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作能够在传统方法难以处理的高密度挑战性场景中，实现美式足球运动员的鲁棒检测与跟踪。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Motivation: Vision Transformers在视频动作识别中性能优秀但计算成本高，轻量CNNs效率高但精度不足。现有跨架构知识蒸馏方法存在架构不匹配问题，且忽视了同质CNN教师的价值。

Method: 双教师知识蒸馏框架：1）差异感知教师加权，基于教师置信度和学生预测差异动态融合ViT和CNN教师的预测；2）结构差异感知蒸馏，学生通过轻量辅助分支学习ViT与CNN教师的残差特征，关注可转移的架构差异。

Conclusion: 双教师知识蒸馏框架有效解决了架构不匹配问题，通过异质和同质教师的协同指导，显著提升了轻量CNN学生的性能，为高效视频动作识别提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

TL;DR: DreamPose3D是一个基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过动作感知推理和时间想象来提升姿态估计的准确性和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每帧姿态，无法有效处理模糊运动和泛化到真实场景。受人类理解和预测运动方式的启发，需要结合高层意图推理和时间一致性建模。

Method: 提出DreamPose3D框架：1）使用从2D姿态序列提取的任务相关动作提示动态调节去噪过程；2）引入表示编码器，在注意力机制中融入运动学关节亲和力；3）训练时使用幻觉姿态解码器预测时间一致的3D姿态序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。在广播棒球数据集上测试也表现出色，能够有效处理模糊和噪声的2D输入，保持时间一致性和意图驱动的运动变化。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理、结构关系建模和时间一致性预测，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理模糊运动和真实场景时表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异构图学习的个性化LLM路由方法，通过将用户-LLM多轮交互建模为异构图，在少量数据下有效学习用户偏好，实现高效个性化路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏充分个性化，难以捕捉用户与LLM之间的复杂交互关系，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、嘈杂且格式不一致，限制了仅依赖用户特定数据的方法效果。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点类型的异构图，通过定制化的消息传递机制，在轻量级归纳图学习框架中从少量数据学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter始终优于强基线方法，准确率提高0.9%到21.6%，AUC提高0.006到0.309。更重要的是，仅需少量数据即可适应新用户和演化偏好，无需大量微调。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过异构图建模有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在少量数据下实现高效个性化，为LLM路由系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

Method: 从Reddit收集真实的人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o在相同主题上生成人工对话，然后让研究参与者并排比较判断对话来源。

Result: LLM生成的对话有39%的时间被误认为是人类创建的，Llama 3生成的对话只有56%的时间被正确识别为AI生成，仅略高于随机概率。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话来欺骗人类读者，这既显示了社会模拟的潜力，也警示了LLMs可能被滥用来生成新的不真实社交媒体内容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

Conclusion: 通过结合增强的安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架，可以为开发能够在敏感法律领域提供伦理和安全协助的LLM奠定基础，确保其成为法律的保护者而非无意中的违反者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

Motivation: 由于LLM对社会影响日益增大，其代表多元视角的能力至关重要。但研究发现RLHF和DPO等对齐算法显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致文本结构重复、问题解决方式趋同、社会视角范围变窄。

Result: 从能力角度看，使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务上获得更高准确率，产生语义和词汇多样性更强的输出；从对齐角度看，能代表更广泛的社会观点并改善logit校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能有效提升LLM输出多样性同时保持或改善性能。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，利用同一模型生成的缓和有害查询作为新输入，在零样本和少样本条件下实现了最高65%的转换成功率和41%的越狱成功率，揭示了自动评估高估危害性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制假设攻击者来自外部，但模型自身输出可能成为新的攻击向量，这一可能性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出Self-HarmLLM场景，使用同一模型生成的缓和有害查询作为新输入，在GPT-3.5-turbo等模型上进行零样本和少样本实验，结合前缀自动评估和人工评估。

Result: 零样本条件下最高52%转换成功率和33%越狱成功率，少样本条件下最高65%转换成功率和41%越狱成功率，自动评估平均高估52%的危害性。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑护栏设计并建立更稳健的评估方法，证明该方法可作为有效攻击场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例，解决了传统手动创建耗时且通用大语言模型缺乏领域知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动创建言语语言病理学临床案例耗时且劳动密集，而通用大语言模型缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉内容，需要大量专家修订。

Method: 构建了多模型RAG系统原型，整合了精选领域知识与工程化提示模板，支持5个商业和开源LLM，设计了7个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。

Result: 概念验证展示了RAG增强生成儿科SLP案例的技术可行性。商业模型质量略有优势，但开源模型表现也可接受，适合隐私保护的机构部署。整合精选知识库使生成内容符合专业指南。

Conclusion: 该系统为自动生成儿科SLP临床案例提供了可行方案，未来可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思训练等应用，但需要进一步专家验证和测试。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了DisCoCirc形式主义到孟加拉语，应用于英孟翻译任务，发现该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面存在局限性，特别是处理结构差异时表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将DisCoCirc形式主义从英语扩展到孟加拉语，并评估其在英孟翻译任务中的有效性，特别是检验其减少语言官僚主义的能力。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法框架，开发孟加拉语版本，应用于英孟翻译，分析框架在处理语言结构差异时的表现。

Result: 发现DisCoCirc虽然对大部分语言有效，但由于两种语言的结构差异，在翻译任务中仍面临限制，即使处理简单句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在翻译任务中存在约束，与先前声称的效果不符，这突显了框架的局限性，并为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

Motivation: 医疗决策支持系统对急诊医生快速准确评估患者状况至关重要，大语言模型在医疗决策支持领域具有应用潜力，但单个模型的诊断能力有限。

Method: 使用元学习方法构建超级学习器MEDAS，集成五个主要LLM（Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT、Claude），通过元学习器学习每个LLM的不同能力来提升整体诊断准确率。

Result: 单个LLM的诊断准确率在58%-65%之间，已超过人类医生报告准确率；超级学习器MEDAS实现了70%的诊断准确率，其中至少一个集成LLM达到85%正确诊断率。

Conclusion: 基于元学习的超级学习器能够利用多个LLM的集体知识，其聚合诊断准确率超过任何单个LLM，表明集体知识整合可显著提升医疗诊断性能。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应的梯度感知数据选择方法(GrADS)，通过分析初步训练阶段的梯度来识别有效的训练数据子集，仅使用5%的选定数据就能超越全数据集微调的性能，同时显著缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多任务中取得了显著成就，但监督微调对于适应专业领域仍然至关重要。然而，领域专业化的监督微调资源密集，且由于灾难性遗忘可能导致通用能力下降。

Method: 提出GrADS方法，设计自引导标准，利用梯度的大小和统计分布来优先选择对模型学习过程贡献最大的样本，从而获取能够增强LLMs对领域特定任务理解的代表性样本。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融等多个领域的各种LLMs上进行广泛实验，GrADS表现出显著的效率和成本效益。仅使用5%的选定GrADS数据，LLMs的性能就超过了在全数据集上微调的模型，使用50%的数据则带来显著改进，同时灾难性遗忘问题得到显著缓解。

Conclusion: GrADS方法通过梯度感知的数据选择，在显著减少训练数据量的同时提升模型性能，并有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题，为LLMs的领域专业化提供了高效且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者自述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在复杂认知类别提取方面优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验描述可以提供疾病相关认知和情绪变化的重要见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型家族：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令跟随模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在上下文相关类别如思维和社交互动方面表现优异。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 由于复杂认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠特性，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性。但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在参考文献推荐中存在生成不存在论文的幻觉问题，本研究假设模型正确生成参考文献的能力取决于底层知识是生成的还是记忆的，高引用论文在预训练语料中出现频率更高，幻觉率更低。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的引用，通过手动验证和计算生成与真实元数据之间的余弦相似度来测量事实一致性。

Result: 结果显示：(i)引用次数与事实准确性高度相关；(ii)当引用次数超过约1000次时，参考文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；(iii)当多个高引用论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明存在一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值，高引用论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型并行生成与自回归模型质量优势之间的平衡问题，实现高吞吐量、高GPU利用率和AR级别质量的协同效应。

Method: 使用结构化注意力掩码，在单次前向传播中并行扩散生成草稿token（Thinking），然后自回归采样最终输出（Talking）。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上，TiDAR在吞吐量上超越推测解码，在效率和质量上超越Dream和Llada等扩散模型，首次在保持AR模型质量的同时实现4.71-5.91倍的每秒token生成量。

Conclusion: TiDAR成功弥合了扩散模型与自回归模型之间的质量差距，同时实现了显著的吞吐量提升，为语言模型生成提供了新的高效架构。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EVADE框架，利用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测自然语言推理任务中的标注错误，相比传统人工标注方法更高效且能提升数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言推理等任务中，人类标注变异使得难以区分标注错误与合理变异。传统VARIERR框架需要两轮人工标注，成本高昂且可能限制合理标签或解释的覆盖范围。

Method: 提出EVADE框架，使用大语言模型生成和验证解释来检测错误。通过分布比较、验证重叠和模型微调影响三个维度，全面比较人工和LLM检测的错误。

Result: LLM验证使生成的解释分布更接近人工标注，从训练数据中移除LLM检测的错误比移除人工识别的错误能带来更好的微调性能提升。

Conclusion: LLM验证具有规模化错误检测的潜力，能在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异下的数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators.

Conclusion: SpiralThinker将迭代计算与潜在推理相结合，证明对齐的迭代更新可以可靠地在潜在空间中引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估主要依赖短时静态对话，无法捕捉情感支持的动态和长期特性，需要转向基于轨迹的用户中心评估方法。

Method: 构建包含328个情感情境和1152个干扰事件的大规模基准，采用经过验证的情绪调节策略约束模型输出，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情感估计方法。

Result: 通过对多种LLMs的广泛评估，揭示了不同模型在情感支持能力上的显著差异，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: 提出的轨迹级评估框架能够有效捕捉用户情感动态，为LLMs的长期情感支持性能提供全面评估，揭示了模型能力的显著差异并指导未来发展。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Motivation: 解决LLM在金融、医疗等受监管行业中由于随机性限制而无法满足严格政策要求的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用LLM（可选人工指导）将自然语言政策形式化；第二阶段通过推理时自动形式化验证逻辑正确性，并在必要时进行冗余形式化交叉检查。

Result: 基准测试显示该方法超过99%的可靠性，在识别逻辑有效性方面接近零误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可审计的逻辑工件，能够验证结果并用于改进原始文本，为受监管行业提供可靠的政策合规验证方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了流式语音识别中的上下文截断问题，在安多藏语识别任务上取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估和多目标强化学习有效提升了检索增强生成在多步推理任务中的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估大语言模型的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默回应时缺乏同理心，且评估标准与人类存在根本差异：LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑同理心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常依赖单维度评估LLMs的幽默能力，本文认为需要多维度理解幽默，通过Oogiri游戏填补这一研究空白。

Method: 扩展现有Oogiri数据集，用LLMs生成回应，然后人工标注六个维度的5分绝对评分：新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智力、同理心和整体趣味性。

Result: LLMs能生成介于低到中阶人类水平的回应，但表现出明显的同理心缺失。相关性分析显示LLMs评估时优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑同理心。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成和评估方面与人类存在根本差异，释放标注语料库以推动开发更具情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Conclusion: 个性化英语阅读材料生成方法能有效提升EFL学习者的阅读理解能力和学习动机，为EFL教育中的个性化学习提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

TL;DR: DoPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过检测特征图中的异常频率带并重新参数化，有效改善Transformer模型的位置编码外推能力，显著提升长上下文任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE位置编码在Transformer模型中存在长度外推限制，导致注意力模式失衡和注意力下沉现象，影响模型在长上下文中的表现。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，基于截断矩阵熵检测异常频率带，并使用无参数高斯分布重新参数化特征图以实现稳健外推。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务中，DoPE在长达64K token的扩展上下文中显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 位置嵌入的去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉现象，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改善长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

TL;DR: LoopTool是一个完全自动化的、模型感知的数据演化框架，通过紧密集成数据合成和模型训练来改进工具学习。它通过三个协同模块迭代优化数据和模型：能力探测、标签验证和错误驱动数据扩展。

Motivation: 当前工具学习受到静态合成数据管道的限制，数据生成和模型训练是分离的非交互过程，无法自适应关注模型的具体弱点，且存在噪声标签问题，降低了训练效率。

Method: LoopTool包含三个协同模块：(1)贪婪能力探测(GCP)诊断模型的掌握和失败能力；(2)判断引导标签验证(JGLV)使用开源判断模型查找和纠正标注错误；(3)错误驱动数据扩展(EDDE)基于识别出的失败生成新的挑战性样本。

Result: 实验表明，使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越了其32B数据生成器，并在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到了其规模的最新最先进结果。

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLMs的工具使用能力，在成本效益高的开源生态系统中运行，消除了对昂贵闭源API的依赖。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在表格问答中直接输入整个表格作为长文本往往导致错误答案，因为大多数LLM无法固有地捕捉复杂的表格结构。

Method: 使用语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制计算给定问题与单个单元格的相似度来估计表头，然后在最相关行和列的交集处选择答案单元格，并通过对比学习在小数据集上训练语言模型以提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在表格问答中有效提升了性能，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来进一步改进性能并缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Motivation: 针对之前研究中sequentiality度量方法存在主题选择偏差且缺乏真实有效性验证的问题，本文旨在验证仅使用上下文术语的简化版本是否更有效。

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的论文数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），比较上下文版本、主题版本和原始sequentiality度量方法，并与零样本LLM预测和标准语言特征进行组合分析。

Result: 上下文版本的sequentiality与人类对组织性和连贯性的评估更一致；当与标准语言特征结合时，上下文度量比主题版本和原始版本增加更多预测价值，甚至优于零样本LLM预测。

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动作文评分和相关NLP任务。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Motivation: 传统的子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，但本文探索在训练过程中动态优化子词分割，以研究子词在语言模型训练中的演变规律。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型框架，支持预训练和微调，针对三种形态类型不同的语言进行训练：聚合型的isi-Xhosa、分离型的Setswana和中间型的英语。

Result: 识别了子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调过程中子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能提升低资源形态复杂语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移性能。

Conclusion: 可学习的子词分割为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了有前景的改进方法，子词在训练过程中会动态演变以适应不同任务需求。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出Anchor方法解决RLVR在诚实对齐中的早期训练崩溃问题，通过在rollout中注入真实轨迹来稳定学习过程，显著提升语言模型的演绎推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法只优化最终任务结果，在早期训练中当负奖励占主导时容易崩溃，特别是在诚实对齐任务中，模型需要既能回答可解答查询，也能识别无法从前提得出结论的情况。

Method: 提出Anchor方法，在强化学习的rollout过程中注入真实轨迹，防止早期训练崩溃；使用从图结构构建的两个多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理）进行实验。

Result: 实验表明GRPO方法在这些任务上表现不佳，课程学习有一定帮助但需要精心设计的数据集；Anchor方法能稳定学习过程，显著提升整体推理性能。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于实现对齐语言模型中可靠的演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过注入真实轨迹有效解决了早期训练崩溃问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

TL;DR: POTSA是一个基于跨语言平行语音对和最优传输的新框架，旨在弥合高资源和低资源语言之间的翻译差距，通过偏置补偿模块和token级OT约束来改善语音大语言模型的多语言语音到文本翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中往往忽略源语言之间的语义共性，导致翻译性能存在偏差。

Method: 提出POTSA框架：1）偏置补偿模块粗略对齐跨语言初始语音表示；2）在Q-Former上施加token级最优传输约束，建立细粒度表示一致性；3）采用层调度策略将OT约束集中在语义最有益的层上。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集上的实验表明，该方法仅使用每个源语言10小时的平行语音数据，就在五种常见语言上平均提升+0.93 BLEU，在零样本语言上提升+5.05 BLEU，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: POTSA框架通过最优传输技术有效改善了语音大语言模型的多语言翻译性能，特别是在资源匮乏语言上表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C³TG是一个用于细粒度、多维度文本属性控制的两阶段框架，通过选择性配对LLM与属性分类器并使用加权KL散度调整token概率，在优化阶段通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以精确控制多个文本属性，特别是在属性要求冲突时缺乏协调机制，且无法在控制生成流程中融入迭代优化过程。

Method: 提出C³TG两阶段框架：生成阶段选择性地将LLM与17个可用维度中的所需属性分类器配对，使用加权KL散度调整token概率；优化阶段利用结合分类器分数和惩罚项的能量函数，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: 实验表明C³TG在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低了毒性。

Conclusion: C³TG是一种有效且灵活的多维度文本属性控制解决方案，无需昂贵的模型修改。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了LiteraryTaste数据集，用于开发个性化创意写作LLM，发现人们在创意写作偏好上存在差异，微调transformer编码器可有效建模个人和集体偏好，但自我报告的偏好对建模实际偏好的效用有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们有不同的创意写作偏好，但现有LLM通常将不同个人品味视为整体进行训练，需要开发能够适应每个用户偏好的个性化创意写作LLM。

Method: 引入LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读偏好数据，包括自我报告的阅读习惯和品味（陈述偏好），以及对100对短创意写作文本的偏好标注（显示偏好）；使用transformer编码器进行微调建模偏好。

Result: 1）人们在创意写作偏好上存在差异；2）微调transformer编码器在建模个人和集体显示偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3）陈述偏好在建模显示偏好方面效用有限；通过LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析了人们偏好的变化方式。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术奠定了基础，证明了建模个人创意写作偏好的可行性，并提供了分析偏好差异的方法。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并发布了新的高棉语极性数据集和微调模型。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdaptDel方法，通过动态调整删除率来改进序列分类的认证鲁棒性，针对编辑距离扰动提供了理论保证和显著的实证改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理不同长度序列时使用固定删除率，导致性能不佳，需要适应不同输入特性的可变删除率方法。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，采用可适应删除率，基于输入属性动态调整，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到可变率删除。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得了强实证结果，认证区域的基数中位数比最先进方法提高了多达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率，显著提升了序列分类对编辑距离扰动的认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

*Arka Mukherjee,Shreya Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准，基于印度JEE Advanced考试，评估发现前沿VLMs在复杂推理任务上表现优异，而开源模型表现停滞，揭示了现有基准无法区分的真实推理能力差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准无法充分区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更严格的基准来评估模型的真实推理能力。

Method: 构建了包含1,460个问题的多模态双语基准mmJEE-Eval，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域，评估了17个最先进模型在复杂推理任务上的表现。

Result: 前沿VLMs在2025年问题上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型停滞在37-45%，封闭模型在元认知推理增加时性能崩溃（GPT-5仅修复5.2%错误）。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval能够有效区分优秀的训练和推理方法，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆，为评估真实推理能力提供了更好的基准。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

TL;DR: SeerSC是一个动态自一致性框架，通过整合系统1和系统2推理，同时提高令牌效率和降低延迟。系统1快速计算答案熵来评估样本扩展潜力，系统2进行动态自一致性推理，实现并行生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展方法虽然通过动态自一致性减少了令牌消耗，但仍受限于顺序请求的高延迟问题。

Method: 利用系统1快速计算答案熵来评估样本扩展潜力，在系统2下实现动态自一致性，通过并行生成降低延迟。

Result: 与现有方法相比，令牌消耗减少高达47%，推理延迟降低43%，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC框架有效解决了LLM推理中的令牌效率和延迟问题，通过系统1和系统2的协同工作实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SPARQL到Cypher转换解决方案存在局限性，需要RDF图或外部工具支持。S2CLite旨在提供一个纯粹基于规则的、无需依赖外部资源的轻量级解析器。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法（受传统编程语言编译器启发），无需RDF图或外部工具，将SPARQL查询翻译为Cypher查询。

Result: 在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上的实验表明，S2CLite显著减少了查询解析错误，在Spider4SPARQL上达到77.8%的总解析准确率，优于最先进的S2CTrans的44.2%。在两者都能解析的查询子集上，S2CLite的执行准确率达到96.6%，比S2CTrans高出7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite是一个有效的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，显著优于现有方法。同时生成了Spider4SSC数据集，包含4525个独特问题和3组等效查询（SQL、SPARQL和Cypher），为文本到查询语言研究提供了统一资源。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在任务特定评估中表现有效，但不确定这种能力是否能扩展到更通用的文本质量评估，特别是在多语言环境中。

Method: 首先自动生成文本质量偏好数据，然后使用这些数据训练开源基础大语言模型，使其与高质量和低质量文本的评分对齐。

Result: 在115种语言上的综合评估表明，所提出模型的性能得到改善，并且这种增强的评估能力还能显著提升下游任务的表现。

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架在多语言文本质量评估方面表现出色，证明了大语言模型在通用文本质量评估方面的扩展能力。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: AMaPO是一种解决离线偏好优化中过拟合-欠拟合困境的自适应边际方法，通过动态调整学习梯度来提高排名准确性和下游对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法存在过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排名的样本施加过多梯度（过拟合），而对错误排名的样本提供不足的纠正信号（欠拟合），这限制了排名准确性的进一步提升。

Method: 提出自适应边际偏好优化(AMaPO)，采用实例级自适应边际，通过Z归一化和指数缩放来动态重新分配学习努力，放大错误排名样本的梯度并抑制正确样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO不仅实现了更好的排名准确性和更优的下游对齐性能，而且针对性分析确认其成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边际设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为提升语言模型对齐性能提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Motivation: 当前商业多模态大语言模型在低资源语言上表现尚可，但开源社区尚未实现可比结果。本文旨在为低资源语言巴斯克语开发一个强大的多模态大语言模型。

Method: 开发了训练和评估用的图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语适配变体Latxa作为骨干模型，探索了多种数据混合训练策略。

Result: 研究发现：i) 仅需约20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可在巴斯克语基准测试中获得稳定结果；ii) 出乎意料的是，无需巴斯克语指令调优的骨干LLM也能获得强大的巴斯克语MLLM。

Conclusion: 本研究为开发其他低资源语言的多模态大语言模型铺平了道路，并公开释放了相关资源。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更全面、通用和有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向，CARE-Bench能够有效评估模型处理复杂多样化客户的能力。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Result: 该方法在意识流散文数据集上提高了平均绝对误差和准确率指标。

Conclusion: TPoT策略是一种简单而有效的方法，能够改善人格预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将无约束英语翻译为ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，生成完整的ASP程序来解决问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多不熟悉编程语言的人需要与代码交互，需要一种方法让用户能够用自然语言描述问题并自动生成ASP程序，而无需学习ASP语法。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化语言并系统生成ASP约束，最小化LLM的作用。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，展示了该方法的能力。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统的重大第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然人类能轻松解决ARC-AGI问题，但即使是最先进的人工智能系统也难以应对。受神经科学和心理学中人类智能建模方法的启发，旨在开发认知合理的求解器。

Method: 使用神经符号方法，基于向量符号代数(VSA)集成系统1直觉和系统2推理。采用面向对象的程序合成方法，利用VSA表示抽象对象、指导解决方案搜索并实现样本高效的神经学习。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train上得分10.8%，在ARC-AGI-1-Eval上得分3.0%。在较简单基准测试中表现优异：Sort-of-ARC得分94.5%，1D-ARC得分83.1%（以极低计算成本超越GPT-4）。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，在保持计算效率的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

TL;DR: 本文提出将强化学习系统重新设计为可回答环境多样性查询的推理引擎，引入QDIN架构，通过专门的神经模块处理不同类型的查询，发现推理准确性与控制性能之间存在根本性解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统强化学习仅关注奖励最大化的单一目标，探索将RL系统构建为能够回答环境多样性查询的推理引擎，以暴露智能体隐含的环境知识。

Method: 引入Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN)统一架构，为不同类型的查询（策略、可达性、路径、比较）设计专门的神经模块，优化每种推理模式。

Result: 实验显示推理准确性可达近乎完美水平（99%可达性IoU），而控制性能仍保持次优（31%回报），表明准确世界知识表示与控制所需表示存在根本差异。专门化查询架构优于统一模型和后验提取方法，同时保持竞争力控制性能。

Conclusion: 为从初始设计即为可查询知识库的RL系统建立研究议程，对可解释性、验证和人类-AI协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM监督微调方法只能学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力；强化学习方法面临无法区分学生真实理解与答案复述、无法感知学生认知状态变化的挑战。

Method: 提出单向认知优化(UCO)方法，采用多轮交互强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：认知进步奖励评估学生从困惑到理解的转变，支架奖励动态识别学生最近发展区。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模模型，性能与先进闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过认知导向的奖励机制有效提升了LLM作为智能导师的动态适应能力，在教育应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Result: 在Genshin Impact中成功完成5小时蒙德主线剧情，效率达到人类水平；在Wuthering Waves和Honkai: Star Rail中实现零样本泛化，分别完成100分钟和5小时任务。

Conclusion: Lumine在不同世界和交互动态中表现出色，标志着在开放环境中开发通用智能体方面迈出了具体一步。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

TL;DR: 本文认为当前生物声学AI系统虽然跨物种性能出色，但忽视了AI递归认知与其他物种递归通信过程相遇时的根本问题，提出了从通用模式识别转向不同递归认知形式间外交接触的重新概念化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物声学AI系统通过transformer架构、基础模型范式等方法处理动物通信，但忽视了AI递归认知与其他物种递归通信过程相遇时的根本问题。

Method: 借鉴哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性和偶然性的研究，论证AI系统不是中立的模式检测器，而是递归认知主体，其信息处理可能系统性地模糊或扭曲其他物种的通信结构。

Result: 揭示了双重偶然性问题：每个物种的通信通过偶然的生态和进化条件出现，而AI系统通过自身偶然的架构和训练条件处理这些信号。

Conclusion: 解决这一挑战需要将生物声学AI从通用模式识别重新概念化为不同递归认知形式之间的外交接触，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法具有重要意义。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应能力，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Method: 采用递归精炼(RR)方法实现GIS搜索，构建简单线性管道与复杂结构化管道的对比实验，使用三位美国开国元勋的历史人物角色，通过RAG增强语料库生成对当代政治议题的回应。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试案例中始终优于简单模型，平均仲裁分数为88.3对71.7。复杂模型的论证在分析深度、结构细微差别和战略框架方面更优越。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理的稳健架构特征，高质量推理是受控的增量搜索过程。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Conclusion: Argus框架能够有效增强自动驾驶系统的安全性，通过运行时危险监控和缓解机制显著提升驾驶性能并减少安全违规。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹优化问题建模与求解提供了鲁棒、可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，降低了工业应用的专业知识和数据门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应令牌长度减少，并且在Llama和Mistral等其他LLMs上也能很好地泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了新奖励函数在方差减少和改进收敛特性方面的优越性，能够有效解决LRMs中的过度思考问题，提高推理效率和效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

### [108] [Perspectives on a Reliability Monitoring Framework for Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09178)
*Niclas Flehmig,Mary Ann Lundteigen,Shen Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个双层可靠性监控框架，用于解决智能AI系统在运行期间可靠性不足的问题，通过异常检测和透明度层为人类操作员提供决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能AI系统虽然具有自主性优势，但在高风险领域应用时存在可靠性不足的问题，需要开发缓解技术来降低运行期间的不确定性风险。

Method: 提出双层可靠性监控框架：第一层是用于检测新输入的分布外检测层，第二层是揭示内部操作的AI透明度层。

Result: 该框架为人类操作员提供了判断输出是否可能不可靠的决策支持，使其能够及时干预。

Conclusion: 该监控框架为开发缓解技术提供了基础，能够降低智能AI系统在运行期间因可靠性不确定而产生的风险。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedFuse框架通过MuFuse模块使用乘法融合处理不规则临床时间序列，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录中临床时间序列的不规则性（异步采样、缺失值、异质特征动态）以及现有嵌入策略无法有效捕捉值依赖特征交互的问题。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，在保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在涵盖重症和慢性护理的三个真实数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MedFuse是一个可泛化的不规则临床时间序列建模方法，乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

TL;DR: HyperD是一个用于交通预测的新框架，通过将交通数据解耦为周期性和残差分量来处理复杂的时空依赖性和多尺度模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通预测面临复杂空间依赖性和多尺度周期性模式与不规则波动共存的挑战，需要更有效的建模方法。

Method: 提出HyperD框架，包含混合周期性表示模块处理周期性分量，频率感知残差表示模块处理非周期性波动，并使用双视图对齐损失确保语义分离。

Result: 在四个真实世界交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，同时具有更好的抗干扰鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和残差分量，有效解决了交通预测中的复杂时空依赖问题，为智能交通系统提供了更准确的预测方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出从"模型训练"转向"模型培育"的新范式，将价值对齐从模型开发之初就融入其中，通过重新设计训练语料库来实现早期价值承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值对齐，导致模型容易失准且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类能力的生态系统中，这成为关键需求。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：从第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、以及构建训练数据的顺序支架。

Result: 预期这种训练语料库的重新设计将实现从第一个训练标记开始的早期价值承诺，使得知识、技能和价值观本质上更难分离。

Conclusion: 从"模型训练"到"模型培育"的范式转变对于在AI能力超越人类的时代建立深度价值对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Conclusion: 开发专门的定性AI系统对于实现全面的科学理解和推进多学科混合方法研究至关重要，这些系统应具备透明、可复现和隐私保护等核心特性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型的推理能力，特别是端到端规划性能，评估前沿模型在PDDL任务上的表现。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习轨道的PDDL领域子集，评估DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5和LAMA规划器，包括标准PDDL和混淆测试。

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL任务上解决率与LAMA竞争，所有LLM在混淆测试中性能下降但程度比之前模型轻，显示相比前代LLM有显著改进。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM在规划任务上取得重大进步，缩小了与专用规划器在挑战性基准上的性能差距。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 在高维领域中进行科学发现时，访问学习表示中的信息至关重要。需要一种机制来分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示，以便进行科学探索。

Method: 基于潜在流匹配与分类器自由引导的方法，明确分离条件信息与残差表示中的信息，从而解耦潜在子空间。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向实际操作，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过评估模型在真实创造性领域中的程序能力，揭示表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令接地、自然语言到DSL翻译和图像到DSL翻译等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，突显了在真实创造性领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的显著差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全方法依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险无法仅通过检查检测。需要一种架构无关的补充方法来增强安全性。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，利用模型计算输出概率的能力，当足够多的安全模型达成充分共识时输出结果，否则弃权。算法受Vyas等人版权保护算法启发。

Result: 该方法能够实现与最安全s个模型平均风险相当的安全性，并在安全模型足够多且共识充分时提供弃权概率界限。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的模型无关AI安全方法，通过放大集合中未知安全模型子集的安全保证来创建单一可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Motivation: 传统AI依赖符号处理和数据分析模型，而Physical AI将智能理解为身体、环境和经验之间真实交互的涌现现象，需要建立新的理论基础来描述物理体现的智能系统。

Method: 提出了六个基本原理：体现、感知、运动行动、学习、自主性和情境敏感性，这些原理构成一个封闭的控制循环，能量、信息、控制和情境在其中持续交互。

Result: 建立了物理AI的理论框架，展示了六个原理如何作为封闭控制循环相互作用，使系统能够从物理经验而非数据库中生成意义。

Conclusion: 物理AI将智能理解为物理体现过程，学习是智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，而非参数调整。通过康复机器人案例展示了物理智能源于具体体验而非抽象计算。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Motivation: SAM在医学图像分割中潜力巨大，但在少量标注数据时性能受限，而医学数据中存在大量有价值但被忽视的分层信息。

Method: 提出SAMora框架，在图像、补丁和像素级别应用互补的自监督学习目标捕获分层医学知识，引入HL-Attn分层融合模块整合多尺度特征。

Conclusion: SAMora能够有效利用医学数据中的分层信息，显著提升SAM模型在医学图像分割中的性能，同时大幅减少训练成本。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Yet, its performance is limited when only a small amount of labeled data is available, while there is abundant valuable yet often overlooked hierarchical information in medical data. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from self-supervised learning and propose SAMora, an innovative framework that captures hierarchical medical knowledge by applying complementary self-supervised learning objectives at the image, patch, and pixel levels. To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics. SAMora is compatible with various SAM variants, including SAM2, SAMed, and H-SAM. Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and fully supervised settings while reducing fine-tuning epochs by 90%. The code is available at https://github.com/ShChen233/SAMora.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态语义通信需要同时压缩模态间冗余并提升在信道失真下的语义可靠性，现有方法难以兼顾这两方面。

Method: 采用两阶段VIB框架：第一阶段使用单模态VIB分别压缩文本、音频和视频，通过互信息最小化和对抗训练抑制跨模态依赖；第二阶段使用多模态VIB压缩融合表示并增强对信道失真的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个联合优化模态特定压缩、模态间冗余和通信可靠性的原则性框架。

Abstract: Semantic communications for multi-modal data can transmit task-relevant information efficiently over noisy and bandwidth-limited channels. However, a key challenge is to simultaneously compress inter-modal redundancy and improve semantic reliability under channel distortion. To address the challenge, we propose a robust and efficient multi-modal task-oriented communication framework that integrates a two-stage variational information bottleneck (VIB) with mutual information (MI) redundancy minimization. In the first stage, we apply uni-modal VIB to compress each modality separately, i.e., text, audio, and video, while preserving task-specific features. To enhance efficiency, an MI minimization module with adversarial training is then used to suppress cross-modal dependencies and to promote complementarity rather than redundancy. In the second stage, a multi-modal VIB is further used to compress the fused representation and to enhance robustness against channel distortion. Experimental results on multi-modal emotion recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and reliability, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Our work provides a principled framework that jointly optimizes modality-specific compression, inter-modal redundancy, and communication reliability.

Motivation: 随着阿尔茨海默病疾病修饰疗法获批，迫切需要基于最低成本测量方式的早期、客观、准确临床诊断方法。

Method: 使用持久同调分析脑部结构MRI，通过Betti函数将拓扑特征转换为特征向量，结合XGBoost机器学习模型。

Result: 在二分类任务中平均准确率97.43%，灵敏度99.09%；在三分类任务中平均准确率95.47%，灵敏度94.98%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需数据增强或复杂预处理，特别适合小数据集，且拓扑特征与深度学习特征互补，具有与其他模型结合的潜力。

Abstract: Now that disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease have been approved by regulatory agencies, the early, objective, and accurate clinical diagnosis of AD based on the lowest-cost measurement modalities possible has become an increasingly urgent need. In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets. Topological features differ significantly from those commonly extracted using convolutional filters and other deep learning machinery. Because it provides an entirely different type of information from machine learning models, it has the potential to combine topological features with other models later on.

Conclusion: 这是首个利用隐式比特分配实现高质量区域自适应编码的工作，证明了隐式比特分配策略在ROI图像压缩中的优越性。

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.

Motivation: 超低场MRI虽然具有更广泛的可用性，但存在信噪比低、空间分辨率差以及与高场标准对比度不一致的问题。图像到图像的转换可以将ULF图像映射到高场外观，但效果受限于稀缺的配对训练数据。

Method: 在ULF-EnC挑战赛约束条件下（50对3D体积；无外部数据），研究任务适应的数据增强如何影响标准的深度模型进行ULF图像增强。采用强大且多样化的增强技术，包括在高场数据上的辅助任务。

Result: 研究显示，强大且多样化的数据增强显著提高了保真度。提交结果在公共验证排行榜上按脑掩模SSIM排名第三，在最终测试排行榜上按官方得分排名第四。

Conclusion: 任务适应的数据增强技术可以有效改善超低场MRI图像增强的性能，特别是在配对训练数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI promises broader accessibility but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced spatial resolution, and contrasts that deviate from high-field standards. Imageto- image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement. We show that strong, diverse augmentations, including auxiliary tasks on high-field data, substantially improve fidelity. Our submission ranked third by brain-masked SSIM on the public validation leaderboard and fourth by the official score on the final test leaderboard.
